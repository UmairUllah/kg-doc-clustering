Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is still unknown but the fire destroyed 6,000 feet of conveyor belt. The company said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation along several ramps and drifts in the mine. Production at the mine has been suspended until investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986. The smelter continues to operate with available concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said. Reuter
