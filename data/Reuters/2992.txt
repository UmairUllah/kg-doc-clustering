It said the rules would require owners and operators of the tanks containing petroleum products or certain hazardous chemicals to monitor the tanks for leaks and, in case of leaks, to notify appropriate authorities. The owners and operators of petroleum tanks would also be financially responsible for any contamination, the EPA said. It said financial requirements for chemical tanks will be proposed later. Hazardous tanks are regulated separately. EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said "Thousands of underground storage tanks are currently leaking and, without adequate controls, many more can be expected to leak in the future, endangering our nation's drinking-water supplies." He added in a statement "We intend to ensure that each underground tank is either upgraded or closed down and that safe operating and cleanup procedures are following to provide maximum protection from any future leaks." reuter
