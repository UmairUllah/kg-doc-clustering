They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans. "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said. The traders were responding to questions whether they would follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde. The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment criteria. "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added. Reuter
