The new firm, Yamaha-Olin Metal Corp, will share facilities with Yamaha in Iwata, which are expected to come on line in the third quarter of 1988., it said. The two companies first joined forces in August 1983 when Yamaha agreed to process and market one of Olin's alloys. The agreement led to a 1985 reroll agreement that involved a number of alloys, it said. Reuter
