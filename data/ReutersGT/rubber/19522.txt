Coffee exports rose to 753 mln dlrs from 580 mln in 1985, but rubber shipments fell to 625 mln from 720 mln and tin to 180.6 mln from 246 mln, weekly central bank figures show. Indonesia hopes to boost its non-oil exports to make up for oil revenue lost because of lower prices. But the lower value of commodities such as timber, rubber, palm oil and tea on world markets has prevented this, despite a 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah against the dollar in September. REUTER
