This improvement reflects the government's efforts over the last seven years to extend existing cocoa plantations and plant new higher yielding varieties, particularly at the northern tip of the island, they said. Last year, Madagascar exported 2,189 tonnes of high quality cocoa, up from 1,624 in 1985, the Trade Ministry said. This year's exports are estimated at 2,400 tonnes. Reuter
