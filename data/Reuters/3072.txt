Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book-squaring featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market. Dealers said the market was switch and straddle-bound, in that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be reflected in adjacent deliveries. The undertone, however, remained cautious as operators await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying, dealers said. The market was originally forecast to open with average five stg gains from last night following New York's firmer close yesterday, dealers said. But this was largely counter-balanced by currency factors. Near July traded at its session low of 1,327 stg after one hour versus 1,333 bid last night and an early high of 1,335. Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed and 108 switches. There was no sign of any origin activity. REUTER
