The figure, which excludes construction and public works, put the January index, base 1980, at 99 after 101 in December. January output was 1.98 pct down on January 1986. INSEE, which from January changed its base year to 1980 from 1970, originally had December output down 2.2 pct on November, using the old base year. INSEE said production in January was affected by rail strikes and severely cold weather. It said output of gas and electricity was very high but activity slowed on construction sites, in quarries and in certain base industries. REUTER
