Roubatis told reporters the Soviet Union agreed to buy the plant's entire annual output of 600,000 tonnes of alumina. More details would be given later by Greek Industry Undersecretary George Petsos, who was in Moscow. The project was due to start in 1986, but problems over plans to sell some alumina to Bulgaria caused delays. The Soviet Union, which was to take 400,000 tonnes, later agreed to take the full production. REUTER
