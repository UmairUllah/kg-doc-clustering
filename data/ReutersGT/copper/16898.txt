The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40 series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994. The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said. Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000 tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said. The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast of Tasmania. The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10 mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions and deferred royalties and payroll taxes. REUTER
