Tay Thiam Peng, manager for international trading at the Trade Development Board, said the decision would boost Singapore's image as a major delivery port. "We hope this will encourage more metal traders to set up shop here and that Singapore can become a delivery port for other metals as well," he said. The new contract, to start trading on June 1, is LME's first dollar-contract. REUTER
