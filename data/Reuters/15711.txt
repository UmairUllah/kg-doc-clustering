A basket is a local measure equal to 46 lbs. Paddy output in 1984-1985 was 699.1 mln baskets, it said. Burma's "Green Revolution" sparked by the introduction of high-yield variety paddy strains in the mid-1970s appears to have hit a plateau with production levelling off over the past two years, economists said.
