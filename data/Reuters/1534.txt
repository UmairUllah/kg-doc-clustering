"A significant part of this monthly decrease was attributable to the impact of the increase of the Canadian dollar on prices for wood pulps, newspaper, aluminum, nickel and motor vehicles," the federal agency said. On a year-over-year basis, the index was down 0.8 pct, little change from the 0.9 pct decline posted in January. Reuter
