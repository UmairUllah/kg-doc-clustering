Agriculture Ministry Permanent Secretary Robbie Mupawose said it had been found at a ranch in southwestern Matabeleland province and that all measures were being taken to contain it from spreading. "The effect of this outbreak on Zimbabwe's beef exports is being examined," he added in a statement. Zimbabwe exports a wide range of meat products to neighbouring states and some 8,000 tonnes of high-grade beef to the European Community annually worth about 48 mln U.S. Dlrs. REUTER
