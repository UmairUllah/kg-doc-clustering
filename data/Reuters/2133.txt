He told journalists the exact decline would depend on dollar developments. The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its business outside West Germany. Spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. World group net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended September 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales which fell to 40.00 billion marks from a previous 44.32 billion. Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen expected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected losses in the mass steel-making operations this year. Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this year, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel turnover and sales volume. This would also affect Thyssen's trading operations, he said. Spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article published this week which spoke of a dispute between him and Heinz Kriwet, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl AG, over planned job cuts in steel plants in the Ruhr area.
