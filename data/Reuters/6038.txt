"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris," Miyazawa told a press conference following the Group of Seven meeting here. He added that the current discussions were a "reaffirmation" of that agreement, indicating that the "solidarity" that occurred in Paris was still in place. reuter
