Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due to the strong yen and lower oil prices. Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice price paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the Rice Price Council, an advisory body to the ministry, on July 1 and 2. The consumer rice price is usually set in December. REUTER
