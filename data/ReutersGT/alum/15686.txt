Elaborating on plans disclosed in outline last September, company officials said current smelting capacity of 390,000 tonnes a year would be cut to between 250,000 and 260,000 tonnes by 1989 or 1990. They did not say where cuts might be made. Two years ago, before selling its Ormet Corp subsidiary in the United States to local management and staff, Alusuisse had an annual capacity of 800,000 tonnes. REUTER
