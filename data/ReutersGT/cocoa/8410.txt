The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought on the current temporao harvest has pushed prices well above international levels, the sources noted. The only buyers are bean exporters or local processors covering previously contracted commitments, they added. If sales were made they would be executed by individual exporting companies which are members of the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission, they said. Reuter
