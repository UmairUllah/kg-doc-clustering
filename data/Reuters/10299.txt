She said USDA has notified Australia, which assured it that stricter controls would be implemented. The Australian government had already imposed residue controls and it is believed the meat with the presticide residues was already in the pipeline before the controls were put in place, the spokeswoman said. There have been five other cases of Australian meat which had residue levels above U.S. allowable limits this year, she said. Reuter
