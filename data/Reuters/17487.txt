Last week, Iowa Beef said it would lift a lockout in effect at the plant since mid-December, which affected 2,800 members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Both union and non-union meatpackers who returned to work, agreed to comply with Iowa Beef's last contract offer. "Start-up went well today and operations will continue to pick up as employees return and others are hired," according to a company statement. Picketing UFCWU members at the plant did not disrupt operations, a company spokesman said. "Our employees are asked to continue to return to work at 8AM unless otherwise notified," he said. Iowa Beef, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp, said it is beginning to take applications for permanent positions at the plant. Reuter
