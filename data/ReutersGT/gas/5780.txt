It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead at six months notice. The proposal, which needs approval by EC ministers, would not force any member state to impose the ban. "It's an option, not an obligation," a spokesman said. But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage the use of unleaded fuel, as well as making it easier for gas stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to stock. Reuter
