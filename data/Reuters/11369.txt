Reagan said the accord is designed to stabilize rubber prices without disturbing long-term market trends and to foster expanded natural rubber supplies at reasonable prices. It continues a buffer stock of not more than 550,000 tonnes established by a 197agreement. This will be used to defend a regularly adjusted price range and will be financed equally by importing and exporting members of the agreement. Reuter
