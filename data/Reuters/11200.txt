The main issue at the talks, which opened here yesterday, has been the INRO buffer stock and the manner in which the buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the current international pact for the commodity expires on October 22, they said. The deadline for the start of the new pact is January 1989. Buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during the interim period. Other issues discussed include ratification of the new accord, the officials said. Only Malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming member countries had ratified the new agreement by the beginning of this month. The meeting is due to end on Thursday. REUTER
