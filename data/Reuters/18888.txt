All bids for wheat were rejected. However, the total to date of 5.06 mln tonnes is still substantially more than the 3.03 mln under licence a year ago. The 80,000 tonnes of French maize granted for export moved the total to 135,000 tonnes since the tender opened in February this year. There were no facilities for maize in the previous weekly grain export series. REUTER
