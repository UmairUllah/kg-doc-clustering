In 1986 the Exchange introduced live cattle and pig cash settlement contracts, representing a move away from the problems of cash distortions and squeezes, which initial deliverable "buyers option" contracts created, he said. Although the physical industry is aware of the market and follows its prices keenly, this has not been reflected in market volume, Elmer said. "If we are to achieve our true potential the floor members must give the market much more time and attention," he added. Reuter
