"Members rejected the latest offer by a 2 to 1 margin," Bob Wilson, executive officer of local 174 said. But workers have been asked to remain on the job while negotiations continue. The union has been in negotiations with the Greater New York Association of Meat and Poultry Dealers, a group of meat wholesalers and distributors. The contract expired April 26 and the latest management offer sought "give backs" in holiday and sick leave which the membership rejected, Wilson said. Reuter
