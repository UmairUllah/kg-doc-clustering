The company said the decision to use prebaked anode technolgy used at its Grande Baie, Quebec, and Sebree, Ky., smelters was taken primarily for cost reasons. As a result, it said, the estimated total cost of the planned smelter will be held to 450 mln U.S. dlrs, the low end of the range estimated in mid-May, while the cost of the first phase was cut to 150 mln dlrs from the projected 175-225 mln dlrs.
