The proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil refiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic practices against franchised dealers. But the FTC said fears of refiner-owned stations as part of a scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded. It called the bill anticompetitive and warned that it would force higher gasoline prices for Georgia motorists. Reuter
