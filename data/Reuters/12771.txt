Traders and Internal Trade Department officials agreed last week to commission a study on a structure to regulate maize forward trading and to set up a company, Thailand Commodity Exchange Co Ltd, with 30 businesses as shareholders who will act as brokers in the futures market. Chanthong Pattamapong, a commodities trader asked to to draw up the study, said if the maize futures market succeeds it may be extended to other commodities, perhaps sugar and rubber. REUTER
