A Finance Ministry statement said the increase should boost the price of petrol by 0.13 crowns to an average of 4.21 crowns per litre while light-grade heating oil would go up by 30 crowns per cubic metre to an average of 1,665 crowns. It said oil companies should absorb part of the tax rise internally and not pass it on to consumers as compensation for a reduction in the stocks that the industry is required to keep for Sweden's national petroleum reserve.
